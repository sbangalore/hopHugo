<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>So, you&rsquo;re balding. Perhaps it&rsquo;s too soon. Your hair feels like the empty set before an episode of <em>Between Two Ferns</em>. Well, luckily for you, there is a solution: hair transplants. But, there is a caveat, it does come with some risks. Is a hair transplant right for you? Read on and take the quiz to find out.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Between-Two-Ferns-Movie-Netflix-Zach-Galifianakis.jpg?w=780" alt="Between Two Ferns" title="Between Two Ferns Image" /></p>

<h2 id="what-is-involved-in-a-hair-transplant">What is involved in a hair transplant?</h2>

<p>Think of a hair transplant as something similar to what gardeners refer to as &ldquo;striking&rdquo;. In gardening, this term refers to the process of cutting the stem of one plant, and under suitable conditions, if you place the cut stem in moist soil, the cut stem will grow into a new plant independent from its parent. Same concept applies to hair transplants. The doctor will take hair from the back or side of your head, and place it in the bald region (most likely the top of your head), and like a plant, under suitable conditions, it will blossom into a beautiful garden of hair. No longer will your head feel like the sad chair that has to support Zach Galifianakis weight during a Between Two Ferns interview.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-hair-transplants-all-the-rage-right-now">Why are hair transplants all the rage right now?</h2>

<p>While Elon Musk may be famous for weed references and running boring companies, a little less known is that he was one of the first to get a hair transplant. Yes, you read that right, Elon Musk once supported a balding head. And he is not alone.</p>

<p>According to statistics from the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery, in Europe alone, there were nearly 80,000 hair transplants in 2016. Pattern baldness, the leading cause of hair loss, is genetic, but other major cause include diet, stress, illness, hormonal imbalance and medications. Hair loss and hair transplants have existed for decades, in fact, since the 1940s in Japan. However, only recently has the stigma around hair transplants faded, and the hair restoration surgery industry has been booming as a result.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-hair-replacement-surgery-work">How does hair replacement surgery work?</h2>

<p>There are three main types of hair replacement surgery.</p>

<h3 id="follicular-unit-transplantation-fut">Follicular unit transplantation (FUT)</h3>

<p>Essentially, the surgeon removes a strip of your scalp and it is then separated into much smaller pieces, which may contain as little as one hair on each. Using stitches, the surgeon closes the area of your scalp from where the strip was taken. The surgeon uses a needle or blade to make small holes in your scalp, and in a process called grafting, inserts hairs into these small holes. After all is done, the surgeon and his team cover the surgical sites with gauze or bandages. FUE is the most popular operatoin – it is the one Wayne Rooney had.</p>

<h3 id="follicular-unit-extraction-fue">Follicular unit extraction (FUE)</h3>

<p>A simpler process, and one in which the surgeon and his team shave the back of your head and takes individual follicles out of the scalp skin. Then, the surgeon makes small holes in your scalp and grafts hairs into the holes. As with FUT, the surgeon and his team finish off by covering the surgical sites with bandages or gauze.</p>

<h3 id="hair-plugs">Hair Plugs</h3>

<p>The procedure involves using a punching tool to remove rows of tiny round patches of tissues, each containing roughly twenty hairs, from the back of the head. The surgeon then creates similar sized holes in balding areas and the hairs would be transplanted into the holes and either left to bed in or be stitched up. Plugs are an outdated term for an outdated type of hair transplant popular back in the 1980s.</p>

<p>We do not recommend this procedure!</p>

<p>Old hair plugs can be surgically removed and a number of men have had this procedure, either opting to have them replaced with FUE/FUT or simply to go naturally bald, rather than have the unnatural-looking plugs in place.</p>

<p>Both processes can vary from several hours to several days to complete.</p>

<h2 id="how-long-is-the-recovery-process-and-what-is-it-like">How long is the recovery process and what is it like?</h2>

<p>The recovery process for a few days after the process is completed. Your doctor may prescribe you anti-inflammatories, pain medications, antibiotics, and other medications to help stimulate hair growth.
After a hair transplant surgery, take care of yourself by waiting a few days after the surgery to wash your hair, and for the first few weeks only use mild shampoos. Do not brush or comb your hair for about a week. Do not exercise for about a week as well. You should be fine to get back to work or your usual shenanigans after about 3 days.</p>

<h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-hair-transplants">Pros and Cons of Hair Transplants</h2>

<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>

<h4 id="guaranteed-results">Guaranteed Results</h4>

<ul>
<li>Whether you are getting a head hair transplant, a beard transplant, or an eyebrow transplant, with the right clinic you are guaranteed hair growth in thinning or bald regions</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="natural-appearance">Natural Appearance</h4>

<ul>
<li>Because the process uses your own hair, the hair transplant results in a natural appearance – kind of like dipping your bald region in the fountain of youth (but no, you can not go back to college and relive your fraternity days)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="no-specialized-treatment-necessary">No Specialized Treatment Necessary</h4>

<ul>
<li>After the procedure, the hair is fully functional and fully yours, no necessary additional treatment!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>

<h4 id="most-insurance-plans-do-not-cover-it">Most Insurance Plans do not cover it</h4>

<ul>
<li>but on the bright side, you have Hop.Health to help you find affordable &amp; quality options, at no added expense!</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="recovery-time">Recovery Time</h4>

<ul>
<li>as for any surgical procedure, there is a recovery process, so no tugging, pulling, and exposure to direct sunlight until your hair has recovered.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>And of course</strong></p>

<p>You look less like this guy:</p>

<p>and more like this guy …  just several billion dollars poorer :wink:</p>

<p><img src="/post/images/after.jpg" alt="Elon After" title="Elon Musk hair transplant after" /></p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-dangers-of-hair-transplants">What are the dangers of hair transplants?</h2>

<p>Most likely, after a hair transplant there may be some scarring. Less likely, there are a few side-effects such as infections, crust or pus drainage around surgical sites, scalp pain, itching and swelling, inflammation of hair follicles, bleeding, and losing sensation around the surgical sites.</p>
